# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document outlines conventions and guidelines.

## Commit Conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]
```

### Types

| Type | Description | Version Bump |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `feat` | New feature | MINOR (1.x.0) |
| `fix` | Bug fix | PATCH (1.0.x) |
| `docs` | Documentation only | — |
| `refactor` | Code change (no feature/fix) | — |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks | — |

**Breaking changes:** Add `!` after type → `feat!: breaking change` → MAJOR (x.0.0)

### Examples

```bash
feat: add gemini-tmux-orchestration skill
fix: correct context calculation in statusline
docs: update README with installation steps
refactor: split skill into multiple files
chore: update dependencies
```

- **MAJOR** (x.0.0) — breaking changes
- **MINOR** (1.x.0) — new features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** (1.0.x) — bug fixes, backward compatible
